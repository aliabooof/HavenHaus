1. Introduction
---------------
**Project Title:** Multi-Actor E-commerce System  
**Objective:**  
Develop a comprehensive e-commerce system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The system is designed to support three primary actors (Customers, Sellers, and Admins) with specific functionalities and access levels.  

**Project Duration:**  
From 18/4/2025 to 2/5/2025

**Key Actors:**  
- **Customers:** Can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete purchases.  
- **Sellers:** Manage their products, process orders, and view sales analytics.  
- **Admins:** Have full access, enabling them to manage user accounts, moderate product listings, and assist with customer service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. System Architecture & Technologies
---------------------------------------
**2.1. Overview of Technologies and Tools:**  
- **HTML:** Structures each page (home page, catalog, product details, etc.).  
- **CSS & Bootstrap:** Style the pages for a clean, responsive design using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system.  
- **JavaScript:** Adds dynamic interactions such as updating the cart and handling form submissions.  
- **Local Storage:** Manages local data persistence for products, user sessions, and orders.  
- **Visualization Libraries:** Options include D3.js, Chart.js, or similar libraries for data visualization.

**2.2. Data Flow and Component Interactions:**  
Consider integrating a diagram (manually drawn or with a tool) to illustrate the following interactions:  
- User actions (search, add to cart, checkout) triggering JavaScript events.  
- Communication between the UI components and local storage.  
- Data management flows for different user roles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. User Authentication & Access Levels
----------------------------------------
**3.1. Authorization Mechanisms:**  
- Implement secure user authentication to differentiate between Customers, Sellers, and Admins.  
- Use role-based access control to limit functionalities based on user type.

**3.2. Role-Based Access:**  
- **Customers:** Standard user access with the ability to browse products, transact, and manage personal details.  
- **Sellers:** Additional options to add, edit, and delete products, as well as manage orders and view analytics.  
- **Admins:** Full system access, including user account management and moderation features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. UI/UX and Navigational Structure
-------------------------------------
**4.1. Home Page:**  
- Display featured products and promotions.  
- Use Bootstrap components for a modern and responsive layout.

**4.2. Product Catalog:**  
- Organized list of products with details (name, image, price, etc.).  
- Include an "Add to Cart" button for quick actions.

**4.3. Product Details Page:**  
- Detailed information about each product, including additional images and descriptive options.  
- Provide a "Back to Catalog" button to facilitate easy navigation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Core Functionalities

**5.1. Shopping Cart:**  
- Allow customers to add, remove, and update items in their cart.
